# WildeCard Project

Welcome to the WildeCard project! This fun application is designed to help you decide what to do when you're bored. Instead of going wild, let's get Wilde!

## How It Works

The application is divided into four main categories: Sports, Movies, Video Games, and Music. Each category offers a set of options, and you can choose based on your interests. The program will then provide a suggestion from the chosen category.

## Sports

In the sports category, you can choose your favorite sport and region. The application will then randomly suggest a team for you to watch. Here's a snippet of the sports data:

```python
# Sample Sports Data
option1dict = {
    'Boston Celtics': ("Basketball", "Northeast"),
    'Brooklyn Nets': ("Basketball", "Northeast"),
    # ... (other teams)
    'Vancouver Whitecaps FC': ("Soccer", "Northeast")
}
```

## Movies

For movies, you can choose the genre and age group. The application will then recommend a movie for you to watch. Here's an example of the movies data:

```python
# Sample Movies Data
option2dict = {
    'Coco': ("Action", "0-12"),
    'Zootopia': ("Action", "0-12"),
    # ... (other movies)
    'The Edge Of Seventeen': ("Comedy", "13-18")
}
```

## Video Games

In the video games category, you can select the genre and gaming console. The program will then suggest a video game for you. Here's a snippet of the video games data:

```python
# Sample Video Games Data
option3dict = {
    'Astroâ€™s Playroom': ("Playstation", "Puzzle"),
    'Deathloop': ("Playstation", "Shooter"),
    # ... (other games)
    'ARMS': ("Nintendo Switch", "RPG")
}
```

## Music

Finally, in the music category, you can choose the genre and age group. The application will recommend a song for you to listen to. Here's a snippet of the music data:

```python
# Sample Music Data
option4dict = {
    'Take Five by Dave Brubeck': ("Jazz", "0-12"),
    'So What by Miles Davis': ("Jazz", "13-18"),
    # ... (other songs)
    'Charity Ball by Fanny': ("Rock", "25+")
}
```
